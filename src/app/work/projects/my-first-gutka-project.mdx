## Overview

**My First Gutka** is the first-ever Sikh prayer app designed especially for children. Built with colorful visuals and simple interaction, it helps kids learn to read and sing their Nitnem with ease. Available on both Android and iOS, the app encourages young users (and their families) to engage with Gurbani joyfully and consistently.

## Key Features

- **Sing-Along Mode**: Built-in musical versions of banis help children follow along and improve pronunciation.
- **Pauri Selection Theme**: Allows users to jump to specific sections of banis and navigate intuitively.
- **English Transliteration & Translations**: Supports both reading and understanding of Gurbani.
- **Vishraam & Larivaar Options**: Traditional reading styles are supported to guide correct pronunciation.
- **Light & Dark Themes**: Friendly on the eyes and adaptable to different lighting conditions.
- **Kid-Friendly UI**: Designed with bright colors and simple navigation to suit a young audience.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building and deploying across iOS and Android.
- **Firebase**: Used for app analytics, crash reporting, and cloud functions.
- **AWS S3**: For storing and streaming audio tracks securely and efficiently.
- **Lottie + Reanimated**: To provide smooth, fun animations and engaging transitions.
- **SQLite**: For offline support and caching Gurbani data.

## Challenges and Learnings

Designing an app for kids required a unique approach to usability and accessibility. We focused on balancing simplicity with spiritual depth. Collaborating with parents, educators, and Sikh organizations helped us refine both the design and features. Audio syncing and precise pauri navigation posed technical challenges that we solved with timed metadata and custom audio players.

## Outcome

The app has been widely appreciated by parents and Gurdwaras globally. It’s being used in Sikh camps and households to introduce Nitnem to children in a fun and interactive way. Continued updates aim to support more languages, voices, and interactive learning tools to foster lifelong engagement with Gurbani.
